## 🧠 Overview

We introduces a new task: **Motion-Grounded Video Reasoning**, where models must answer motion-related questions using **spatiotemporal segmentation masks** as visual responses.

This task addresses key limitations in prior video understanding research by introducing:
- ❓ Implicit question-based reasoning  
- 🕒 Motion-aware temporal localization  
- 🧍 Object-level visual grounding  
- 🎯 Pixel-level mask generation across time  
- 🧩 Four question types: **Causal**, **Sequential**, **Counterfactual**, and **Descriptive**

## 📌 Comparison to Prior Tasks

> **Figure 1**: GROUNDMORE fills the gap between referring segmentation, temporal grounding, and reasoning by combining implicit QA with visual spatiotemporal output.

## 📋 Task Definition

The **Motion-Grounded Video Reasoning** task requires models to:

- **Input**:  
  - A video clip `V ∈ ℝᵗˣʰˣʷˣ³`  
  - A motion-related question `Q`

- **Output**:  
  - Spatiotemporal segmentation masks `M ∈ ℝᵗ′ˣʰˣʷ` highlighting the target object

This output represents the reasoning result **visually** by grounding the answer over space and time.

## 🧪 Dataset Details

We collect a new benchmark dataset: **GROUNDMORE**, designed to evaluate fine-grained motion reasoning.

- **1.7K** high-resolution video clips  
- **7.6K** question-answer pairs  
- **249K** object-level spatiotemporal masks  
- Diverse video categories: family scene, animal, ball game, and outdoor activity

## 🧠 MoRA: Motion-Grounded Reasoning Assistant

We propose a baseline model called **MoRA**, built for this task. It integrates:

- **LLaVA** for multimodal reasoning  
- **SAM** decoder for spatial mask decoding  
- **[SEG] token** for object semantic embedding  
- **[LOC] token** for temporal localization of motion events  
<!-- - **Spatiotemporal pooling** from video transformer encoders   -->

## 🚀 Usage

### GroundMoRe Download
GroundMoRe is available at: 
https://huggingface.co/datasets/groundmore/GroundMoRe

### Training
Before training, you need to obtain [LISA](https://huggingface.co/xinlai/LISA-7B-v1/tree/main) and [SAM](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything/sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth) for model initialization.

Put SAM pretrained weights at ```./pretrain_weights/```

### Zero-Shot Training
We use [Refer-YouTube-VOS](https://youtube-vos.org/dataset/vos/), [MeViS](https://github.com/henghuiding/MeViS) dataset for zero-shot training.

```
bash run.sh
```

### GroundMoRe Evaluation

```bash
python evaluate_groundmore.py
```
